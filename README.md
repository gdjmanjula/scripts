## What is this bunch of random files?

A few samples of scripts I've written for various projects and clients. Most are quite simple.

There are more scripts for Windows because I just have more of them on hand. In Linux and *nix, scripts are more natural so I generally didn't bother to copy them over. If I needed a script Ñ I'd just write one and put it in place.

## Filetypes

* CMD Ñ Windows Command Line
* JS Ñ JavaScript
* LSP Ñ newLISP
* PHP Ñ Obviously, PHP
* PS1 Ñ PowerShell
* SH Ñ Shell Script
* VBS Ñ Visual Basic
